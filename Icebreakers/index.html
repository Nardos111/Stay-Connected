              This website is a space where those who just need a break can come
              together and either participate in relaxation techniques or
              de-stress by playing fun games with friends, coworkers, or
              classmates.
              <h4>Why was the website created?</h4>
              The website was created to ensure that people could find a way to relax and de-stress from their long virtual classes, and it provides a space where they can do quick activities between classes or during a break by either being able to reset their mind, energize their bodies, or connecting with classmates and coworkers through fun activities.

              <p>
                Amongst the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been harder for classmates, colleagues, and coworkers to come together in a more meaningful way than just signing into a virtual meeting and talking about the tasks they need to complete. Being able to take a break but still collaborating and spending unrelated enjoyable time with the same people you’re working with in a way that is energizing, fun, relaxing, or therapeutic can be a great way to improve overall academic and workplace productivity and can help strengthen relationships within these settings. Through [website], we encourage those who interact virtually to use this platform to feel as connected as possible to those they may be working with during these hard times.

              <h1>What is Zoom Fatique?</h1>
              <p>
                Zoom fatigue” describes the tiredness, worry, or burnout associated with overusing virtual platforms of communication. Like other experiences associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Zoom fatigue is widely prevalent, intense, and completely new.
Audio has been proposed as the main reason that video meetings are draining. It turns out that millisecond delays in virtual verbal responses negatively affect our interpersonal perceptions, even without any internet or technical issues. Other explanations attribute the fatigue to an underlying predisposition painted by the pandemic backdrop, such as increased financial stress and unemployment. Cognitive factors are also likely to contribute to fatigue as an increased ability to virtually multitask threatens our attentional capacity.
