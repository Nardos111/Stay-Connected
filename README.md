<h1>Stay Connected</h1>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
Stay Connected is a space where those who just need a break can come together and either participate in relaxation techniques or de-stress by playing fun games with friends, coworkers, or classmates.
 
Why was the website created? 
 
The website was created to ensure that people could find a way to relax and de-stress from their long virtual classes, and it provides a space where they can do quick activities between classes or during a break by either being able to reset their mind, energize their bodies, or connecting with classmates and coworkers through fun activities.
